red_color_alerts
================

This is a ruby script used to alert you when there's a red-color alert in your area.
You need to set your area (e.g - Tel Aviv is 157).

Then, set up a Twilio account (get an SMS activated number, SID and token).

That will allow the script to send SMSes to your phone.

Recommendation - install an app on your phone to that makes a loud noise when recieving an SMS with a certain text in the body. I personally use Ring my Droid (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ramandeepbakshi.ringmydroid)
